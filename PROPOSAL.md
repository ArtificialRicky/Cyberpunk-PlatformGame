I want to implement a Stage Clear RPG, like Supper Mario. the player will control the charactor to jump, run, and atop enemies to clear the stage.

I think this game is similar to what we did in IdealGas Project. Therefore, I can use a similar idea to implement different functions on the character and other tools. 

When I was working with the ideal-gas project, I found my interest in visualizing some moving stuff through computation. So, I try to explore my interest in this field.

- By the end of Week 1, I will implement the basic function of the character, enemies, wall, box.
star:
    - CMake
    - character: able to move left and right and jump
    - enemies: moving in routine
    - wall: enable character to stand on them


- By the end of Week 2, I will visualize the Map on Cinder and will simply showing moving from one point to another.
star:
    - character: jump onto wall or enemies
    - enemies: disappear when char is atop of them
    - end the game when char reaching the ending point

* By the end of Week 3, I will complete the I/O of the navigation app.
    - visual the game on cinder 

* If I finish the project early, I am choosing implementing playing record after winning the game, or adding some funny barriers in game.
